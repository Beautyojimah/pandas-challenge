# pandas-challenge

This repository contains a Pandas projects for data analysis called PyCitySchools. Within the PyCitySchools folder, there is a pandas script that shows the analysis of a city's schools. A comprehensive report of the analysis and the  csv files (schools_complete and students_complete) used for the analysis are also contained within the folder.

## Pandas Challenge Description

This repository contains a Python script that analyses the district-wide standardised test results for students' math and reading scores to show trends in school performance. Firstly, this analysis shows a summary of the schools including the school name, school type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math score, average reading score, % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading) and % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading).

Secondly, the analysis shows the highest-performing Schools by percentage overall passing. 

Similarly, it shows th lowest-performing schools by overall passing.

Also, the analysis categorises the math scores by grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school. 

Likewise, it categorises the reading scores by grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

In addition, it shows the school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

As well, it shows the break down of the school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large). 

Finally, the analysis shows the school performance based on the "School Type".
